                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other

for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to

control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
includes interface definition files associated with source files for

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
